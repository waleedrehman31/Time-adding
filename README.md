# Adding Two Times Using OOP Technique.

- The main problem is.
  - `Create a class called time that has separate int member data for hours, minutes, and seconds.One constructor should initialize this data to 0, and another should initialize it to fixed values.Another member function should display it, in 11:59:59 format.todo Overload the binary operator ‘+’ to add two objects of type time.A main () program should create two (t1 & t2) initialized time objects and the one t3 that isn’t initialized. Then using overloaded ‘+’ operator function to apply the command t3 = t1 + t2. Finally it should display the values of all three time objects.`

## TODO

- [x] Create a class called time that has separate int member data for hours, minutes, and seconds.
- [x] One constructor should initialize this data to 0, and another should initialize it to fixed values.
- [x] Another member function should display it, in 11:59:59 format.
- [x] Overload the binary operator ‘+’ to add two objects of type time.
- [x] A main () program should create two (t1 & t2) initialized time objects and the one t3 that isn’t initialized.
- [x] Then using overloaded ‘+’ operator function to apply the command t3 =t1 + t2
- [x] Finally it should display the values of all three time objects.
